The end goal is to utilize Google Cloud Natural Lang API to
analyze the uploaded medical documents, and highlight repeated symptoms
and organize the reports in a more apporachable format between doctors.
In addition, for those symptoms with constant occurances, the user would
be prompted on some undetermined time basis to inquire if symptoms are
presistent.

The CSV files contained in the 'MedDocs' folder were generated from a
massive CSV of medical record sample data from Kaggle.com. It was broken
in parts for demonstration purposes to exist as sperate medical history
reports from different offices/medical professionals. Since, of course,
laws prohibit including actual medical record data for such use.
